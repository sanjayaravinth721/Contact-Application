# Contact-Application
I have created a full stack contact application by **front-end using HTML,CSS,JS,EJS** and by **back-end using Node.js, NoSQL with mongoose framework** and installed the necessary **json dependencies packages** with the help of **npm** 

**Setup and install**
To run this app, follow the instructions here,

# Step 1 : install node.js https://nodejs.org/en/.
-Installation Steps

-Download the Windows installer from the Nodes.js® web site. 

-Choose the LTS version that’s shown on the left. 

-Run the installer (the .msi file you downloaded in the previous step.)

-Follow the prompts in the installer (Accept the license agreement, click the NEXT button a bunch of times and accept the default installation settings).

-Restart your computer. You won’t be able to run Node.js® until you restart your computer.

-Confirm that Node has been installed successfully on your computer by opening a Hyper terminal and typing in the commands node --version

-you should see the version of node you just installed.
         
# Step 2 : install hyper terminal https://www.hilgraeve.com/hyperterminal-trial/.

# Step 3 : Download my zip code and extract to your particular folder.

# Step 4 : Now, open the hyper terminal and change the directory to particular location which has extracted **ex:(cd "F:\Contacts")** and click enter.

# Step 5 : Type **node app.js**, it will shows **port started at 2000** in the terminal.

# Step 6 : After that go to the chrome and enter the address **locahost:2000** and it will render it into the application page.
